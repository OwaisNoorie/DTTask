This is a WhatsApp-like frontend created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As no Figma file or design resources were given, this is the maximum I could achieve by designing the layout and functionality on my own assumptions. It shows creation of webpages, a responsive chat interface, and dynamic features like rendering chats and messages from JSON data.
